% multifile directive is used to declare that a predicate may have multiple clauses that are defined in different source files.

% dynamic directive is used to declare that a predicate can be modified dynamically at runtime using the assert/1 and retract/1 built-in predicates. 
:- dynamic
    i_am_at/1,
    at/2,
    ate/1,
    gave/2,
    dead/0,
    in_inventory/1,
    talked/1,
    path/2,
    found/1.

% retract is a built-in meta-predicate used to remove facts or rules from the Prolog database while a program is executing
