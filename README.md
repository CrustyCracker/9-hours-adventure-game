## Topic
Welcome to the "9 Hours" project, an adventure game where you put yourself in the shoes of Bart, a last minute student who has 9 hours to finish his project. The task at hend doesn't seem too easy, as the time limit is quite harsh. Also, Bart wakes up with a headake and stomachake. Moreover, he has no idea where his roommates went. It wouldn't be a problem, if they weren't supposed to compleate the project with him. What are you waiting for? Go look for your friends! You shouldn't be expected to do the project on your own, right?
